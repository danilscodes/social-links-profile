### Links

- Live Site URL: [Social links profile](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

- HTML base layout
- CSS
- make sure it looks good on all screen sizes
- hover states

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

reviewed some BS5 classes
- w-100 makes the div take up the width of the parent
- d-grid makes the buttons take up the width of the parent
- gap-3 puts gaps between the buttons

```html
<div class="social-links w-100 d-grid gap-3">
  <button>GitHub</button>
  <button>Frontend Mentor</button>
  <button>LinkedIn</button>
  <button>Twitter</button>
  <button>Instagram</button>
</div>
```

### Continued development

- I'm not sure how helpful Bootstrap is. I thought it would help me more on this challenge, but I ended up only using it for the buttons section. I guess I'd like to learn more about Bootstrap and how to evaluate if I need it or not.
